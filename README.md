# imgrecall

## Introduction

My first side project. Got the inspiration for it when an image I was viewing was recalled and disappeared.

In Wechat, when an image is recalled, Wechat will automatically delete that image from the image folder on your computer.
Wechat uses XOR encryption for the images it stores, and each computer has a different 'key' that is used to encode these images.
imgrecall will automatically calculate the encryption key value for each user to decode images.
If imgrecall detects a file it has been watching has been deleted/recalled, it will decode the .dat file and replace it with a .png file.

The python script I wrote is a very lightweight program that gets those images back.
imgrecall watches your Wechat image folder for automatically downloaded images and creates a backup of anything new it sees.
It also keeps a list of every newly added image within the last 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, photos can no longer be recalled, so it deletes the backup.

## Features

Copies the .dat file that images are stored as in Wechat to another location.

If the image is recalled, the .dat copy is decoded to give the original image as a .png file.

If the image is not recalled for longer than 5 minutes, the .dat copy is deleted.

Note that the image must have appeared on your computer at some point. If the image is recalled before Wechat even sees it, then it will not catch it.

## Future Improvements

Currently only supports .jpg files, but most images sent from a phone will be jpgs. Will include support for .png and .gif in the future.

## Usage

1. Make sure Wechat is running with Auto-dowload of files enabled.
2. Run imgrecall.py using python 3. A console window should open,
3. Enter your desired output folder path into the window.
4. Enter your wechat image folder. The format should be similar to C:\Users\\\{computer username}\Documents\WeChat Files\\\{wechat username}\FileStorage\Image
5. Any photos recalled should now appear in your output folder.

## Versions

* 1.2 - released an executable version of imgrecall
* 1.1 - allows users to define folder paths via user input
* 1.0 - created the functional program
