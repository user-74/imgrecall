# imgrecall

Copies the .dat file that images are stored as in wechat to another location.

If the image is recalled, the .dat copy is decoded to give the original image as a .png file.

If the image is not recalled for longer than 5 minutes, the .dat copy is deleted.

## Usage

1. Change 'output_path' in imerecallpwn.py to the folder you want to store your images
2. Change 'img_folder' to 
C:\\Users\\(your username)\\Documents\\WeChat Files\\(your wechat username)\\FileStorage\\Image\\
3. Run wechat and run imerecallpwn.py.
